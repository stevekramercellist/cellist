 description="My grandfather on my mother's side was one the most decorated WWII soldiers and a true hero who was wounded three times and a survivor of 'The Battle of Berlin'. Excerpt from a family-storytelling. It was a frosty January of 1943. The command of the 'Voronezh Front' was preparing an offensive: 'Ostrogozhsk-Rossosh' operation. Rossosh was the largest railway junction and a supply base for many enemy formations occupied by the Italian Alpine Corps. The liberation of the city meant the collapse of the entire right front of the fascist group. The offensive began at dawn on January the 14th., from the Kantemirovka area and the Pasekovo railway station. After artillery preparation, infantry regiments of the 180th and 48th Guards Divisions of the 3rd Panzer Army executed the attack. The enemy's front edge was numbed with fixed firing points. The infantry layed down, and the battles to break through the first defensive line were protracted. On January the 16th., the 180th division entered the city of Rossosh from the direction of Mitrofanovka. The 42nd Rifle Regiment was commanded by my grandfather, the Guard Major Gavriil Semenovich Kozhevnikov. A professional soldier - in the Red Army since 1931 - since the beginning of the war, he always had been at the forefront. In October of 1941 my grandfather took part in the battles near Kamenka (battle for Moscow), where he was first wounded. In August-September 1942, he skillfully led the military operations of the regiment near Rzhev (Western Front), for which he was awarded his first 'Red Star'. The enemy retreated with battles. The battle for Rossosh took on the character of short but grisly battles. The enemy fiercely resisted in the area of the railway station, on the railway station streets, on the northern outskirts of the station and at the poultry farm, where large ammunition depots were located. Eyewitnesses recalled that the Nazis settled on the roof of the railway station and opened heavy fire in response to any movement (from the side of today's Proletarskaya). Soldiers of the Soviet Army dug passages in the snowdrifts and thus were able to quietly approach the enemy. The battles for the city continued for several days.  On January the 17th., Rossosh and its environs were cleared of the Nazis. The rout of a large enemy grouping was completed. For the liberation of the city of Rossosh, my grandfather was awarded the Order of the Red Star, already the second since the beginning of the war. In Rossosh he met his love - the beautiful Shura Zimbalist, my grandmother. During the occupation, in order not to be noticed by the Nazis, she and her younger brother literally lived in a barn, starving and freezing. History is silent about the circumstances under which my grandmother and grandfather met, but this fact became very significant. After that, my grandfather had new battles and new exploits. In the 43rd Regiment - the crossing of the Dnieper. In the 44th Regiment, he was transferred to the 2nd Belorussian Front, where he first commanded the 769th Regiment and then the 661st Regiment of the 200th Rifle Regiment Division. Differs in the East Prussian operation: on February the 7th., 1945, the regiment of my grandfather's, near the village of Topolno, defeated a group of Germans. In this battle 600 soldiers and officers were captured and taken as prisoners, among the trophies were 300 carts with various property, 20 guns and larger amounts of other military equipment. On the 17th,. of February of 1945, my grandfather personally, despite strong enemy artillery and mortar fire, led the assault on the 'Frankenhofen-stronghold'. During 'The Battle of Berlin', my grandfather was wounded again and for the third time. After victory, he remained to command the 469th Regiment of the 150th Rifle Regiment Division as part of the group of Soviet occupation-forces in Germany. My grandfather was awarded two: 'Orders of the Red Star', three: 'Orders of the Battle Red Banner', also: 'The Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st Degree' and many more medals. In 1955 my grandfather and grandmother moved to live in Rossosh. In 1968 my grandfather was awarded the title: 'Honorary Citizen of the City of Rossosh'. My grandparents lived a long and fulfilling life. My grandmother passed away in March of 1994, and my grandfather passed away, July of 1996." %}

description="Luncheon following artistic collaboration with my dearest friend, architect and amateur cellist, David Traub and his colleague. David Traub wrote two jewels: 'Searching for Philadelphia, The Concealed City,' and 'Discovering Philadelphia, Places Little Known.' David Traub created as a part of the 1982 tercentenary celebration of the founding of Philadelphia, ‘The Concealed City’, building bridge historically to the sequel, ‘Places Little Known’. The respective reader takes a fabulous journey through a myriad of corridors, from the narrowest of streets and alleyways, public squares and hidden gardens, bringing to light the 'secret city,' that most residents and tourist never will see. The second 'footprint' of true historic bliss welcomes us to rather unusual sites, from charming interiors and hidden pockets, old mansions, cemeteries and urban oases, and so on and so forth. David Traub, a native ‘Kentuckian’, born and raised in Louisville, obtained his greater learning and degrees at the prestigious University of Pennsylvania, under the tutelage of Louis I. Kahn. David Traub developed and worked projects such as the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, restoring a Victorian carriage house in the Fairmount section of Philadelphia, and has conquered tales of artistic collaborations with world-leading composers and artists, encompassing names prominent as the composer Igor Stravinsky, and the legendary cellist Gregor Piatigorsky, the cello teacher of my first and former cello teacher, Erling Bløndal Bengtsson." %}
