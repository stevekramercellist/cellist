description="Luncheon following artistic collaboration with my dear friends, composer Michael Shingo Crawford and architect and amateur cellist, David Traub. David Traub wrote two jewels: 'Searching for Philadelphia, The Concealed City,' and 'Discovering Philadelphia, Places Little Known.' David Traub created as a part of the 1982 tercentenary celebration of the founding of Philadelphia, ‘The Concealed City’, building bridge historically to the sequel, ‘Places Little Known’. The respective reader takes a fabulous journey through a myriad of corridors, from the narrowest of streets and alleyways, public squares and hidden gardens, bringing to light the 'secret city,' that most residents and tourist never will see. The second 'footprint' of true historic bliss welcomes us to rather unusual sites, from charming interiors and hidden pockets, old mansions, cemeteries and urban oases, and so on and so forth. David Traub, a native ‘Kentuckian’, born and raised in Louisville, obtained his greater learning and degrees at the prestigious University of Pennsylvania, under the tutelage of Louis I. Kahn. David Traub developed and worked projects such as the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, restoring a Victorian carriage house in the Fairmount section of Philadelphia, and has conquered tales of artistic collaborations with world-leading composers and artists, encompassing names prominent as Maestro Igor Stravinsky, and the legendary cellist Gregor Piatigorsky, the cello teacher of my teacher of cello." %}
