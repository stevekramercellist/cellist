The Steve Kramer Entertainment Group focuses on providing the highest class of entertainment and reaching underserved children in order to teach the importance and joy of classical music.

We provide a roster of nearly all different configurations of ensembles bringing together the country's best musicians and educators.

My partners in music, known as the Steve Kramer Entertainment Group, are an outstanding team of performers and educators who help to build music programs, bringing interactive music education and performances to students in K–12. The ensemble generates a string quartet and its subsets, which perform all styles and genres from the early renaissance to contemporary. The musicians collaborate with a wide range of artists, including pianists and wind players, who are accredited from the nation’s finest institutions.

In addition to the entertainment group's residency and music training programs, the artists involved offer in-school performance opportunities and private lessons in performance and composition.

The Steve Kramer Entertainment Group welcomes your generous donation-gifts of music instruments and accessories. If you are able to make a conribution, please contact Steve Kramer using the [contact form](http://stevekramercellist.com/contact.html). 

Steve Kramer Entertainment Group's performance experiences have reached prestigious clients and the world-renowned concert halls, amongst them, the Highlands Mansion, Radio City Music Hall, Kimmel Center, MGM Grand, Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia Art Museum, Franklin Institute, Strawberry Mansions, Woodmere Art Museum, the National Constitution Center, Novo Nordisk A/S, Datwyler, and Valley Forge Tourism & Convention Board.
