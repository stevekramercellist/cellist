# MUSIC SALON OF SARASOTA
Music Salon of Sarasota by Steve Kramer was launched April 7th of 2024 together with Steve’s wife, Anna Kramer, daughter Emilia, and son Victor, in their home once belonging to Bogoljub Ronac, a survivor of the Holocaust. Steve Kramer presented ‘Artists of Honor’, the legendary respected and beloved jazz pianist Dick Hyman and Sculptor Julia Hyman.

The sought-after and immensely popular Music Salon is conducted every first Sunday of the month, and Steve Kramer brings together an international community of musicians, artists, authors, poets, painters, sculptors, and photographers—many of whom are both friends and colleagues—to play all periods, genres, and styles of music and exhibiting their artwork.

The Salon requires a donation which is given as an honorarium to guest musicians. All extra donations are welcomed and support the performing musicians and artists. Each guest is also invited to bring an hors d’oeuvre, desert, or wine for an intermission buffet. Steve, Anna, Emilia and Victor will welcome you with open arms and share a most unique, fun, and fiery musical experience.

The earliest Music Salons are believed to have sprung out of Italy, soon populating France during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution, the Music Salon became a seat for lively political debate. Austria and Germany were also on the forefront of embracing the Music Salon. The musical events shaped a platform for women dominating numerous art forms and enjoying principal positions. Composers, and performers would play instrumental music that often was sentimental, beautiful, fun, and suitable for a chamber room setting rather than the concert hall. Composers and performers associated with the salons include, Frantz Josef Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frederic Chopin, Carl Maria von Weber, Franz Liszt, Svitoslav Richter, and many others. Salons also helped change the ways money was allocated for the arts and public institutions, and by creating social awareness. The Music Salon was once upon a time a small gathering of specific people—of elite people. It was held in a designated room in the house used for the reception of visitors. During the 19th century, composers, musicians, and very fine people from the aristocracy would meet in Music Salons and enjoy listening to great music, such as the Lobkowitz, Schwarzenberg, Lichnowsky and many more.
